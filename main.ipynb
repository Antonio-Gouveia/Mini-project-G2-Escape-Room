    "# Mini project ESCAPE ROOM - Group 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This game was developed as a Python Analytics Quest as part of the DA IronHack bootcamp! The mission was: to code a text-based game, 'Escape Room', utilizing Python skills learned in the bootcamp and demonstrates concepts such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data structures: dictionaries and lists to represent rooms, doors, keys, and relationships.\n",
    "- Function design and modularization → all game logic is stored in a separate `.py` file, imported into this notebook.\n",
    "- State management: the `game_state` dictionary tracks current room, collected keys, and progress.\n",
    "- User interactio: via `input()` choices to explore rooms and examine items.\n",
    "- Time control: using the `time` module to implement a 10-minute countdown timer.\n",
    "- Game loop logic: room exploration, item examination, and progression until escape or game over.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚪 Goal\n",
    "Your mission is simple:  \n",
    "**Find the right keys, unlock the doors, and escape the house before time runs out!**"
