# ðŸ§© Escape Room - Mini Project (Group 2: AntÃ³nio Gouveia, Elba Grosso Sheridan, Miguel Florindo and Sofia Scomazzon)

Welcome to **Escape Room**, a text-based adventure game developed as part of the **Python Analytics Quest** during the **Data Analytics Bootcamp at IronHack**.

This project was created by **Group 2** and showcases the Python skills acquired throughout the bootcamp, combining logic, structure, and creativity into a thrilling escape challenge.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

The goal was to design and code a fully functional **Escape Room** game using Python. Players must explore rooms, collect keys, and solve puzzles to escape before time runs out.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Data Structures**  
  Use of dictionaries and lists to represent rooms, doors, keys, and their relationships.

- **Function Design & Modularization**  
  All game logic is stored in a separate `.py` file and imported into the main notebook for clean separation of concerns.

- **State Management**  
  A `game_state` dictionary tracks the current room, collected items, and overall progress.

- **User Interaction**  
  Players interact with the game via `input()` prompts to make choices and explore.

- **Time Control**  
  A 10-minute countdown timer is implemented using Pythonâ€™s `time` module to add urgency.

- **Game Loop Logic**  
  The game includes a loop for room exploration, item examination, and progression until escape or game over.
